# ADR-001: Centralized Logging Strategy

**Status:** Accepted  
**Date:** 2024-01-15  
**Decision Makers:** Development Team  
**Consulted:** Operations Team, Security Team  
**Informed:** Product Team

## Context and Problem Statement

Our NestJS microservices application requires a robust, scalable logging strategy that supports:

- Request tracing across service boundaries
- Structured logging for observability
- Integration with existing infrastructure (BullMQ, EventStoreDB)
- Development and production environments
- Compliance and audit requirements

## Decision Drivers

### Technical Requirements

- **Observability:** Trace requests across microservices and async operations
- **Performance:** Minimal impact on application performance
- **Scalability:** Handle high-volume logging in production
- **Integration:** Work seamlessly with existing tech stack
- **Debugging:** Enable effective troubleshooting and monitoring

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Reliability:** Logging failures should not affect application functionality
- **Security:** Sensitive data protection and audit trail
- **Maintainability:** Simple configuration and reasonable maintenance overhead
- **Cost:** Efficient resource utilization

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Basic Console Logging

- **Pros:** Simple, built-in to Node.js
- **Cons:** No structured format, no trace correlation, difficult to parse
- **Verdict:** Insufficient for microservices architecture

### Option 2: Winston + Custom Transport

- **Pros:** Mature library, flexible transport system
- **Cons:** Heavy configuration, performance overhead, complex trace correlation
- **Verdict:** Over-engineered for our needs

### Option 3: Pino + NestJS Integration (Chosen)

- **Pros:** High performance, JSON structured, excellent NestJS integration
- **Cons:** Learning curve for team
- **Verdict:** Best balance of performance and features

### Option 4: External Logging Service (DataDog, Splunk)

- **Pros:** Fully managed, advanced features
- **Cons:** High cost, vendor lock-in, data sovereignty concerns
- **Verdict:** Cost prohibitive for current scale

## Decision

We will implement a **centralized logging strategy** using:

1. **Pino** as the core logging library
2. **nestjs-pino** for NestJS integration
3. **nestjs-cls** for async context propagation
4. **Grafana Loki** for log aggregation and querying
5. **Promtail** for log shipping
6. **Grafana** for visualization and alerting

### Core Architecture Components

#### 1. Structured Logger (`structured-logger.ts`)

```typescript
// Canonical log shape with typed helpers
Log.info(logger, message, {
  service: 'user-service',
  component: 'UserController',
  method: 'getUser',
  userId: '123',
  timingMs: 45,
});
```

#### 2. CLS Integration (`logger.factory.ts`)

```typescript
// Automatic context injection from async context
const logger = buildAppLogger(cls);
// Automatically includes traceId, userId, correlationId
```

#### 3. Trace Middleware (`trace.middleware.ts`)

```typescript
// HTTP trace propagation and CLS context setup
// Supports W3C traceparent and custom headers
```

#### 4. Multi-Sink Transport

```typescript
// Environment-driven destination selection
// stdout | console | loki | elasticsearch
```

## Rationale

### Why Pino?

- **Performance:** 5x faster than Winston in benchmarks
- **Memory:** Lower memory footprint due to worker thread architecture
- **JSON Native:** Structured logging by default
- **Ecosystem:** Rich transport ecosystem

### Why CLS (Continuation Local Storage)?

- **Automatic Context:** No manual trace ID passing
- **Async Safe:** Works across Promise chains and async/await
- **Framework Agnostic:** Works with HTTP, BullMQ, EventStore

### Why Loki + Grafana?

- **Cost Effective:** Open source, self-hosted
- **Label-Based:** Efficient querying without full-text indexing
- **Integration:** Works well with existing Grafana infrastructure
- **Retention:** Configurable retention policies

## Implementation Details

### Log Levels and Environments

```typescript
// Production: warn and above
// Staging: info and above
// Development: debug and above
// Test: error only
```

### Required Log Fields

```typescript
type BaseCtx = {
  service: string; // Low-cardinality service identifier
  component: string; // Class or module name
  method: string; // Function or operation name
  timingMs?: number; // Operation duration
  expected?: boolean; // Mark benign conditions (e.g., 404s)
};
```

### Trace Propagation Strategy

1. **HTTP Requests:** Extract from `traceparent` or `x-request-id` headers
2. **BullMQ Jobs:** Embed trace context in job data
3. **EventStore Events:** Include in event metadata
4. **Internal Calls:** Automatic via CLS context

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
// Structured error logging with context preservation
Log.error(logger, error, 'User creation failed', {
  service: 'user-service',
  component: 'UserService',
  method: 'createUser',
  userId: undefined,
  validationErrors: errors,
});
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

- **Improved Observability:** Complete request tracing across all services
- **Faster Debugging:** Structured logs with correlation IDs
- **Performance Monitoring:** Built-in timing metrics
- **Audit Compliance:** Comprehensive audit trail
- **Cost Efficiency:** Self-hosted logging stack

### Negative Consequences

- **Learning Curve:** Team needs to learn new logging patterns
- **Infrastructure Overhead:** Additional services to maintain (Loki, Grafana)
- **Initial Setup Time:** Comprehensive implementation required
- **Storage Requirements:** Structured logs consume more space

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk                     | Impact | Probability | Mitigation                               |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Performance degradation  | High   | Low         | Benchmarking, async transports, sampling |
| Loki storage growth      | Medium | Medium      | Retention policies, log level tuning     |
| Team adoption resistance | Medium | Low         | Documentation, training, gradual rollout |
| Log shipping failures    | Low    | Medium      | Multiple transports, fallback to stdout  |

## Monitoring and Success Criteria

## Appendix B: Security Considerations

### Data Classification

- **PII Handling:** Automatic redaction of sensitive fields
- **Access Control:** Role-based access to log data
- **Retention:** Compliance with data protection regulations
- **Audit Trail:** Immutable log entries with integrity verification

### Security Controls

```typescript
// Automatic PII redaction
const sensitiveFields = ['password', 'ssn', 'creditCard'];
const redactedContext = redactPII(context, sensitiveFields);

// Access control integration
const hasLogAccess = await checkPermission(userId, 'logs:read');
```
