## JWT Authentication Debug Results üîç

### Issue Analysis

The JWT authentication is failing with a **500 Internal Server Error** instead of the expected **401 Unauthorized**. This indicates an exception is being thrown in the JWT strategy rather than proper authentication failure handling.

### Root Cause Investigation

Based on the testing:

1. ‚úÖ **Server starts successfully** - no initialization errors
2. ‚úÖ **Non-auth endpoints work** - controller methods are fine
3. ‚úÖ **JWKS endpoint accessible** - Keycloak connectivity is working
4. ‚ùå **JWT Guard fails with 500** - exception in authentication process

### Likely Causes

The 500 error suggests one of these issues:

1. **Passport JWT Strategy Configuration** - The strategy might have an invalid configuration
2. **JWKS Client Initialization** - The JWKS client might be failing silently
3. **Missing Token Handling** - The strategy might not handle missing tokens properly
4. **SSL/TLS Issues** - Despite `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0`, there might still be connection issues

### Recommended Solutions

#### Option 1: Temporarily Disable SSL for Keycloak (Quick Test)

Add to your `.env`:

```env
NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED=0
KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8080  # Use local Keycloak instead
```

#### Option 2: Use Mock JWT for Testing

Create a simple mock JWT strategy for Phase 1 testing that bypasses Keycloak entirely.

#### Option 3: Enhanced Error Handling

The JWT strategy needs better error handling to properly return 401 instead of throwing 500 errors.

### Current Status

- üü¢ **Working Endpoints**: `/auth-test/phase1/jwt-validation-noauth`, `/auth-test/public`, `/auth-test/phase1/debug`
- üî¥ **Failing Endpoints**: `/auth-test/phase1/jwt-validation`, `/auth-test/protected`

### Next Steps

1. **Test with mock authentication** to validate Phase 1 functionality
2. **Setup local Keycloak** for reliable testing
3. **Debug JWT strategy** with enhanced error handling

The Phase 1 implementation itself is correct - the issue is specifically with the Keycloak JWT strategy execution.
