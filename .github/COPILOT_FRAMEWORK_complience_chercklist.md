# Fintech Compliance Gaps Checklist

> Scope: POPIA (ZA), FICA/AML-CFT, PCI DSS (if card data in scope), SARB/PASA payments participation, and baseline ISOâ€¯27001/SOCâ€¯2 controls. Tailored to your stack: EventStoreDB (ESDB), Redis, BullMQ/Outbox, Keycloak, OPA, Slack notifications, Doppler (secrets), GitHub Actions CI/CD.

**How to use**

- Treat each checkbox as a control you must design, implement, and evidence.
- Add an _Owner_, _Due_, and link _Evidence_ (runbooks, screenshots, configs).
- Prioritise: ðŸ”´ Critical (legal/regulatory), ðŸŸ  High (security), ðŸŸ¡ Medium (process).

---

## 1) Governance & Registration

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Determine regulatory perimeter & licences required (e.g., accountable institution under FICA; payment-activity authorisations under SARB/PASA).
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Appoint Compliance Officer; define Board/ExCo oversight and reporting cadence.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Establish a documented Compliance Program Charter (scope, roles, change control).
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Create a Control Register mapping every item below to policy + evidence.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

## 2) POPIA Privacy Program

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) for all services and queues (ESDB, Redis, BullMQ, Slack).
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Lawful-basis mapping for each purpose (contract, legitimate interest, legal obligation, consent where required).
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Data Subject Rights process (access, rectification, deletion/objection) + SLAs; automation hooks into projections and notification logs.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Breach notification runbook ("as soon as reasonably possible") with contact tree and regulator templates.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Data minimisation standards for domain events & logs (no PAN/PII; use tokens/IDs).
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Retention & deletion schedule for events, projections, logs, Slack messages; cryptographic deletion patterns for immutable streams (see Â§7).
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Crossâ€‘border transfer assessment (POPIA s72); vendor DPAs and transfer mechanisms.
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Privacy by Design check in SDLC (DPIA for new features with personal data).

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 3) FICA / AMLâ€‘CFT (if in scope)

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Register with FIC as an Accountable Institution (if applicable) and file RMCP.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Implement KYC onboarding controls; retain KYC + transactional data â‰¥5 years post-relationship/transaction.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Sanctions & PEP screening integrated in workflows; keep screening logs.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Suspicious/Unusual Transaction Reports (STR), Cash Threshold Reports (CTR), Terrorist Property Reports (TPR) processes + tooling.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Transaction monitoring scenarios & thresholds with tuning governance.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Staff AML training & annual attestations; keep attendance records.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 4) PCI DSS (only if cardholder data ever touches your systems)

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Scope decision: **Avoid** storing/processing/transmitting PANâ€”use PSP tokenisation; else define network segmentation and SAQ/ROC path.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ MFA everywhere in-scope; strong auth for admins and service accounts.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Prohibit PAN/track/CVV in events, logs, Slack, or debug dumps; add preâ€‘commit and runtime detectors.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Quarterly ASV scans + annual penetration tests; remediate findings.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Key management with HSM/KMS, dual control, rotation, and crypto erasure.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 5) SARB / PASA Payments Participation (if performing payment activities)

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Identify relevant payment activities (acquiring, issuing, EFT debits/credits, remittance, eâ€‘money, etc.) and required authorisations.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Scheme/rulebook compliance (applicable EFT/debit order rules, dispute/chargeback handling, reversals, settlement timelines).
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Settlement & reconciliation controls with daily variance reporting.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 6) Security Baseline (ISOâ€¯27001 / SOCâ€¯2)

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Access control: least privilege, JIT/JEA for admin; breakâ€‘glass; SoD for prod changes.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Vulnerability management: SCA, SAST, DAST, container & IaC scanning; patch SLAs.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Incident response: playbooks, tableâ€‘top exercises, postâ€‘mortem policy.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Vendor risk: DPAs, security reviews, data location, uptime SLAs, right to audit.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Change management: approvals, CAB (lightweight), documented rollbacks.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Asset inventory for services, keys, secrets, data stores, queues.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 7) Data Architecture & Eventâ€‘Sourcing Controls

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **PII strategy for events**: store stable identifiers; keep mutable PII in projections; reference via IDs; never emit raw PII to Slack or logs.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ **Rightâ€‘toâ€‘erasure** pattern for immutable streams: encryption envelope per subject + key revocation (cryptoâ€‘delete) OR redaction overlays excluded from projections.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Event versioning policy (semantic, with upâ€‘casters/downâ€‘casters); nonâ€‘breaking changes documented.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Multiâ€‘tenant isolation tests: prove a tenant cannot read anotherâ€™s projections or streams; include fuzz tests.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Idempotency keys & dedup across Outbox/BullMQ/consumers.
- [ ] ðŸŸ¡ Data classification labels on events, snapshots, projections.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 8) Access & Authorization

- [ ] ðŸ”´ Centralised AuthN via Keycloak; MFA enforced for admins; service accounts scoped and rotated.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ AuthZ via OPA: separate **policyâ€‘asâ€‘guard** (access control) from **policyâ€‘asâ€‘businessâ€‘rule**; policy review/approval workflow and version pinning.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Admin surfaces (config UIs, feature flags) require SoD + approvals.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Secrets management via Doppler (or equivalent) with least privilege and audit.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 9) Logging, Monitoring & Audit

- [ ] ðŸ”´ **No PII/PAN** in logs, metrics, traces, or Slack alerts; add structured redaction.
- [ ] ðŸ”´ Tamperâ€‘evident audit logs (hash chain or WORM storage) with retention per POPIA/FICA.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Endâ€‘toâ€‘end correlation: `traceId` + `correlationId` across ESDB events, BullMQ jobs, HTTP/gRPC, and Slack notifications.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Centralised log pipeline (e.g., Loki/ELK) with retention tiers and access control.
- [ ] ðŸŸ  Alerting for auth failures, policy denies, queue backlogs, projection lag, unusual admin actions.

**Owner:** \_\_\_\_ **Due:** \_\_\_\_ **Evidence:** \_\_\_\_

---

## 10) SDLC & CI/CD

**Notes**

- Keep this checklist in version control; link each item to tickets and merge requests.
- For each control, store evidence (screenshots, configs, policy docs) in a dedicated `compliance-evidence/` location with timestamps.
